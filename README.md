# UFO Sightings Webpage
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview of Analysis
The project's purpose was to create a dynamic web page to clearly present historic UFO sighting data.  

## Data Source
Data was presented in the attached JavaScript file [JavaScript file](static/js/data.js/).  

## Built With
* Visual Studio Code
* Chrome DevTools
* JavaScript
* HTML
* Bootstrap CSS

## Results

The following image shows the UFO Sightings homepage.  It was designed with the following visual/structural components: Navbar, Jumbotron header, article title and paragraph, table filters and the table of sightings data.  

When the user is greeted to the page, a full set of data is provided in the table.  Only a subset of data was fed into this demonstration version.  However, scrolling through a full set of data would be cumbersome.  Therefore, a set of 5 filters were incorporate in order to customize the information according to the user's needs.

In order to drill down into the data, the user simply inputs the desired criteria based upon the following search parameters: date, city, state, country and shape.  For example, the following image shows data extraction using 3 of the 5 filters (date, state and shape).
